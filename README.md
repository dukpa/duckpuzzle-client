# Work in Progress
This is the client-side of a platform I'm workin on in order to learn React.
It's a general boilerplate for request-portal-like applications.
Also contains some general boilerplate scripts to help streamline development.

# Component Structure
You can create a component with
```
  npm run add-component  <component-name> [<path>]
```
**component-name** The name of the component in CamelCase

**path** *Optional* The path to the component.

This will create a directory with the following structure:  
componentname  
|   index.js  
|   componentname.js  
|   componentname.hook.js  
With all the bootstraps.
